Analyze a trend following pattern within intraday Forex sessions.

The general hypothesis is: if we have a highest high or a lowest low after the beginning of the NY session, we can expect at least another break on the same direction until the end of the day. This is aligned with the idea of trend following because we wait for the market to give a direction and then expect it to continue with it.

Take a look at the code. It has everything before making the chart itself, which was made in PowerBI. The chart can be seen here:
